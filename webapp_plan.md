# Dog Breed Classifier Web Application Plan

## Project Overview
Build a web application that allows users to upload photos of dogs and receive breed predictions using our trained PyTorch model.

## Technology Stack
- Backend: Python (FastAPI)
- Frontend: React
- Model: PyTorch (ResNet-18)

## Components

### 1. Model Preparation
- Export trained PyTorch model with weights
- Save class mappings (breed names)
- Save normalization parameters
- Create inference pipeline that handles:
  - Image preprocessing
  - Model prediction
  - Converting outputs to confidence scores

### 2. Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- Set up FastAPI server
- Create endpoints:
  - Image upload endpoint
  - Prediction endpoint
- Implement image processing:
  - Validation
  - Resizing
  - Normalization
- Handle model inference
- Configure static file serving for React build
- Return top N predictions with confidence scores

### 3. Frontend (React)
- Create main components:
  - Image upload/preview
  - Drag-and-drop support
  - Results display with confidence bars
  - Loading states
- Implement responsive design
- Handle errors gracefully
- Add basic animations for better UX
- Build process for production deployment

### 4. Deployment
- Dockerize FastAPI server (includes React build)
- Set up production environment
- Consider scalability and performance
- Implement proper error logging
- Add monitoring

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Setup
1. Export trained model
2. Create basic FastAPI server
3. Set up React project
4. Configure FastAPI to serve React in production
5. Test local development setup

### Phase 2: Core Features
1. Implement image upload and processing
2. Add model inference endpoint
3. Create results display component
4. Add error handling

### Phase 3: Enhancement
1. Improve UI/UX
2. Add loading states
3. Implement proper validation
4. Add helpful tooltips/documentation

### Phase 4: Deployment
1. Build React app for production
2. Configure FastAPI static file serving
3. Containerize FastAPI application
4. Deploy MVP
5. Monitor and optimize

## Technical Considerations

### Backend
- Use FastAPI for high performance
- Implement proper request validation
- Handle concurrent requests
- Implement caching if needed
- Consider batch processing for multiple images
- Configure static file serving for React build

### Frontend
- Use modern React patterns (hooks, context)
- Implement proper form validation
- Handle various image formats
- Provide immediate feedback
- Make UI responsive
- Optimize build for production

### Model Serving
- Load model efficiently
- Handle memory management
- Implement batch prediction if needed
- Consider model quantization for production

### Security
- Implement file type validation
- Add size limits for uploads
- Sanitize user inputs
- Configure appropriate security headers

## Development Workflow
1. Development:
   - Run React dev server on port 3000
   - Run FastAPI server on port 8000
   - Enable CORS during development

2. Production:
   - Build React app (npm run build)
   - FastAPI serves static files from build directory
   - Single server handling both API and static files
   - No CORS needed

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Export current PyTorch model
3. Create basic FastAPI server
4. Build simple React frontend
5. Test end-to-end flow locally
