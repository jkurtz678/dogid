Progress Notes for Dog Breed Classification Project

Current Status (as of last run):
- Training with 120 dog breed classes
- Loss around 4.74 (barely improved from random guessing of ~4.78)
- Accuracy ~0.98% training, 1.97% validation (just above random 0.83%)
- Using data augmentation and cosine annealing LR scheduler

Implemented Improvements:
1. Added data augmentation:
   - Random crop
   - Random horizontal flip
   - Color jitter
   - Proper normalization

2. Added learning rate scheduling:
   - Warmup period
   - Cosine annealing
   - Initial LR: 0.0001

3. Added validation monitoring

Next Steps to Implement:
1. Switch to ResNet-style architecture with:
   - Residual connections
   - Better gradient flow
   - Proper weight initialization
   - Deeper network for fine-grained features

2. Add label smoothing (loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(label_smoothing=0.1))

3. Consider:
   - Reducing batch size to 16
   - Increasing initial learning rate to 0.0003
   - Adding mixup augmentation

Model is currently struggling to learn effectively, indicating need for architectural improvements rather than just training optimizations.
