Progress Notes for Dog Breed Classification Project

[December 21, 2024] - Initial Attempt Status:
- Training with 120 dog breed classes
- Loss around 4.74 (barely improved from random guessing of ~4.78)
- Accuracy ~0.98% training, 1.97% validation (just above random 0.83%)
- Using data augmentation and cosine annealing LR scheduler

Implemented Improvements:
1. Added data augmentation:
   - Random crop
   - Random horizontal flip
   - Color jitter
   - Proper normalization

2. Added learning rate scheduling:
   - Warmup period
   - Cosine annealing
   - Initial LR: 0.0001

3. Added validation monitoring

[December 21, 2024] - ResNet Implementation Status:
- Switched to ResNet-18 architecture
- Still seeing similar issues with learning:
  - Loss stuck around 4.77-4.81 (random guess level)
  - Accuracy decreasing from 1.13% to 0.94% during training
  - Learning rate warmup from 0.0027 to 0.0031 not helping

Implemented Changes:
1. Switched to ResNet architecture with:
   - Proper residual connections
   - BatchNorm layers
   - Dropout in classifier (0.5 and 0.3)
   - Kaiming initialization for conv layers

2. Modified training setup:
   - Changed to SGD with momentum (0.9)
   - Added gradient clipping
   - Implemented warmup scheduling
   - Added weight decay (1e-4)

Next Steps to Try:
1. Learning rate adjustments:
   - Reduce initial learning rate to 0.001
   - More gradual warmup (factor 1/1000)
   - Longer warmup period

2. Add more monitoring:
   - Gradient norm tracking
   - Model output statistics
   - Layer-by-layer gradient flow

3. Consider:
   - Reducing model complexity initially
   - Adding label smoothing
   - Checking for data loading/preprocessing issues
   - Verifying model output dimensions

Model is still struggling with initial learning phase, suggesting need to focus on learning rate and initialization strategies before adding more complexity.
