Progress Notes for Dog Breed Classification Project

[December 21, 2024] - Initial Attempt Status:
- Training with 120 dog breed classes
- Loss around 4.74 (barely improved from random guessing of ~4.78)
- Accuracy ~0.98% training, 1.97% validation (just above random 0.83%)
- Using data augmentation and cosine annealing LR scheduler

Implemented Improvements:
1. Added data augmentation:
   - Random crop
   - Random horizontal flip
   - Color jitter
   - Proper normalization

2. Added learning rate scheduling:
   - Warmup period
   - Cosine annealing
   - Initial LR: 0.0001

3. Added validation monitoring

[December 21, 2024] - ResNet Implementation Status:
- Switched to ResNet-18 architecture
- Still seeing similar issues with learning:
  - Loss stuck around 4.77-4.81 (random guess level)
  - Accuracy decreasing from 1.13% to 0.94% during training
  - Learning rate warmup from 0.0027 to 0.0031 not helping

Implemented Changes:
1. Switched to ResNet architecture with:
   - Proper residual connections
   - BatchNorm layers
   - Dropout in classifier (0.5 and 0.3)
   - Kaiming initialization for conv layers

2. Modified training setup:
   - Changed to SGD with momentum (0.9)
   - Added gradient clipping
   - Implemented warmup scheduling
   - Added weight decay (1e-4)

[December 21, 2024] - Training Improvements and Analysis:
- Made significant progress in model training but identified overfitting:
  - Training accuracy reached ~99%
  - Evaluation accuracy only ~25%
  - Large gap between training and eval performance indicates severe overfitting
  - Improved loss stability from ~4.8 to ~0.1-0.5 range
  - Added detailed gradient monitoring per layer

Key Findings:
1. Gradient Analysis:
   - Identified potential vanishing gradient issues
   - Early layers showing larger gradients (conv1: ~2.5) than later layers (~0.9)
   - Classifier layers showing moderate gradients (~1.5)

2. Learning Rate Impact:
   - Initial high learning rate (0.1) showed promising but unstable results
   - Loss fluctuations between batches suggest need for lower learning rate
   - Current warmup schedule may need adjustment

3. Overfitting Issues:
   - Model shows strong memorization of training data (99% accuracy)
   - Poor generalization to evaluation data (25% accuracy)
   - Current regularization (dropout and data augmentation) insufficient

Next Steps to Try:
1. Address Overfitting:
   - Increase dropout rates
   - Add more aggressive data augmentation
   - Consider reducing model capacity
   - Implement stronger regularization techniques

2. Learning Rate Optimization:
   - Reduce initial learning rate to 0.01
   - Fine-tune warmup schedule
   - Monitor loss stability with new settings

3. Address Gradient Flow:
   - Experiment with batch normalization momentum
   - Review initialization strategy
   - Leverage skip connections effectively

4. Validation Analysis:
   - Implement confusion matrix monitoring
   - Monitor train/val metrics more closely
   - Test on new, unseen images

The model shows ability to learn but requires significant work on generalization and preventing overfitting.
