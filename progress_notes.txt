Progress Notes for Dog Breed Classification Project

[December 21, 2024] - Initial Attempt Status:
- Training with 120 dog breed classes
- Loss around 4.74 (barely improved from random guessing of ~4.78)
- Accuracy ~0.98% training, 1.97% validation (just above random 0.83%)
- Using data augmentation and cosine annealing LR scheduler

Implemented Improvements:
1. Added data augmentation:
   - Random crop
   - Random horizontal flip
   - Color jitter
   - Proper normalization

2. Added learning rate scheduling:
   - Warmup period
   - Cosine annealing
   - Initial LR: 0.0001

3. Added validation monitoring

[December 21, 2024] - ResNet Implementation Status:
- Switched to ResNet-18 architecture
- Still seeing similar issues with learning:
  - Loss stuck around 4.77-4.81 (random guess level)
  - Accuracy decreasing from 1.13% to 0.94% during training
  - Learning rate warmup from 0.0027 to 0.0031 not helping

Implemented Changes:
1. Switched to ResNet architecture with:
   - Proper residual connections
   - BatchNorm layers
   - Dropout in classifier (0.5 and 0.3)
   - Kaiming initialization for conv layers

2. Modified training setup:
   - Changed to SGD with momentum (0.9)
   - Added gradient clipping
   - Implemented warmup scheduling
   - Added weight decay (1e-4)

[December 21, 2024] - Training Improvements and Analysis:
- Made significant progress in model training but identified overfitting:
  - Training accuracy reached ~99%
  - Evaluation accuracy only ~25%
  - Large gap between training and eval performance indicates severe overfitting
  - Improved loss stability from ~4.8 to ~0.1-0.5 range
  - Added detailed gradient monitoring per layer

[December 21, 2024] - Optimization and Architecture Updates:
1. Analyzed and Updated Data Pipeline:
   - Calculated dataset-specific normalization values:
     - Means: [0.4762, 0.4519, 0.3910]
     - Stds: [0.2580, 0.2524, 0.2570]
   - Updated transforms to use these values instead of ImageNet defaults

2. Training Hyperparameter Adjustments:
   - Reduced learning rate to 0.001 from 0.01
   - Increased gradient clipping threshold to 5.0
   - Still seeing high loss values and fluctuations

3. Attempted Model Architecture Simplification:
   - Tried simplifying classifier structure to reduce gradient imbalance
   - Initial attempt to remove extra linear layer caused issues
   - Need to properly adjust final layer dimensions to match num_classes

Next Steps:
1. Fix classifier structure:
   - Adjust final linear layer to output directly to num_classes (120)
   - Ensure proper initialization of simplified classifier

2. Continue monitoring:
   - Gradient flow through simplified architecture
   - Loss stability with new learning rate
   - Training vs validation metrics

3. If needed:
   - Consider additional data augmentation
   - Adjust dropout rates
   - Fine-tune learning rate further
