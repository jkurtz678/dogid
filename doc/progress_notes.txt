Progress Notes for Dog Breed Classification Project

[December 21, 2024] - Initial Attempt Status:
- Training with 120 dog breed classes
- Loss around 4.74 (barely improved from random guessing of ~4.78)
- Accuracy ~0.98% training, 1.97% validation (just above random 0.83%)
- Using data augmentation and cosine annealing LR scheduler

Implemented Improvements:
1. Added data augmentation:
   - Random crop
   - Random horizontal flip
   - Color jitter
   - Proper normalization

2. Added learning rate scheduling:
   - Warmup period
   - Cosine annealing
   - Initial LR: 0.0001

3. Added validation monitoring

[December 21, 2024] - ResNet Implementation Status:
- Switched to ResNet-18 architecture
- Still seeing similar issues with learning:
  - Loss stuck around 4.77-4.81 (random guess level)
  - Accuracy decreasing from 1.13% to 0.94% during training
  - Learning rate warmup from 0.0027 to 0.0031 not helping

Implemented Changes:
1. Switched to ResNet architecture with:
   - Proper residual connections
   - BatchNorm layers
   - Dropout in classifier (0.5 and 0.3)
   - Kaiming initialization for conv layers

2. Modified training setup:
   - Changed to SGD with momentum (0.9)
   - Added gradient clipping
   - Implemented warmup scheduling
   - Added weight decay (1e-4)

[December 21, 2024] - Training Improvements and Analysis:
- Made significant progress in model training but identified overfitting:
  - Training accuracy reached ~99%
  - Evaluation accuracy only ~25%
  - Large gap between training and eval performance indicates severe overfitting
  - Improved loss stability from ~4.8 to ~0.1-0.5 range
  - Added detailed gradient monitoring per layer

[December 21, 2024] - Optimization and Architecture Updates:
1. Analyzed and Updated Data Pipeline:
   - Calculated dataset-specific normalization values:
     - Means: [0.4762, 0.4519, 0.3910]
     - Stds: [0.2580, 0.2524, 0.2570]
   - Updated transforms to use these values instead of ImageNet defaults

2. Training Hyperparameter Adjustments:
   - Reduced learning rate to 0.001 from 0.01
   - Increased gradient clipping threshold to 5.0
   - Still seeing high loss values and fluctuations

3. Attempted Model Architecture Simplification:
   - Tried simplifying classifier structure to reduce gradient imbalance
   - Initial attempt to remove extra linear layer caused issues
   - Need to properly adjust final layer dimensions to match num_classes

[December 22, 2024] - Model Regularization and Training Stability:
1. Implemented Label Smoothing:
   - Added LabelSmoothingLoss with smoothing=0.1
   - Helped stabilize loss fluctuations
   - Initial learning showed improvement with loss around 4.64

2. Added Dropout to ResNet Blocks:
   - Initially added 0.1 dropout to all ResNet blocks
   - Saw improved balance between training and validation accuracy
   - Training: 17.28%, Validation: 16.09% (reduced overfitting gap)

3. Further Training Analysis (Epoch 17):
   - Observed return of overfitting (Training: 28.73%, Validation: 20.12%)
   - Gradient norms increased to 11.6637
   - Model outputs showing wider range (-9.5869 to 9.3885)
   - Learning rate decreased to 0.00043 via cosine annealing

4. Latest Adjustments:
   - Increased dropout in second layer to 0.2
   - Raised gradient clipping threshold to 15
   - Extended training duration beyond 20 epochs

[December 22, 2024] - Later Training Results and Code Reorganization:
1. Updated Training Results with Standard ResNet-18:
   - Switched to standard [2,2,2,2] ResNet-18 architecture (from [1,1,1,1])
   - Observed severe overfitting:
     - Training accuracy: 98.87%
     - Validation accuracy: 16.47%
     - Large gap (82%) indicates memorization without generalization
   - Identified high gradient norms in later layers (layer4.0.conv2.weight: 4.4555)

2. Code Structure Reorganization:
   - Refactored project structure for better organization:
     - core/ : Core components (data loading, loss functions)
     - engine/ : Training logic (trainer, training steps)
     - models/ : Model architectures (ResNet, ConvNet)
     - utils/ : Helper functions
   - Added shell script (train.sh) for easier execution
   - Centralized configuration in config.py

Next Steps:
1. Continue addressing overfitting:
   - Implement stronger regularization techniques
   - Increase weight decay to 5e-3
   - Consider more aggressive data augmentation
   - Monitor effects of progressive dropout rates

2. Training Process Improvements:
   - Add TensorBoard visualization for better monitoring
   - Implement improved learning rate scheduling
   - Consider batch size adjustments
